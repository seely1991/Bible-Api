# Bible-Api
Api for searching New King James Version of the Bible

I made the api using a text document I found of the NKjV bible and converted it to a JSON file using regular expressions
[Here's a link to the original text downloaded before conversion to JSON](http://www.truth.info/download/bible.htm)

Search queries support alternate names of certain books (for instance 'Song of Songs' or 'Song of Solomon.'
